# What I find Interesting:
One interesting thing I find from the article is the mention of "low code development" as a trend. 
Low code development tools enable software creation without the need for much coding expertise, enhancing accessibility 
and cost-efficiency. On the other hand, the article underscores the continued significance of software engineering experts 
in supervising and ensuring the effectiveness of low-code solutions. This underscores the enduring value of software 
engineers in directing and enhancing software development procedures, even in the prevailing age of automation.

# What Ethan Sha find Interesting:
The article offers a thorough look at the dynamic future of software engineering, making a compelling argument for why it's a viable and promising career path. It emphasizes the importance of staying updated with emerging technologies and ethical considerations, which I find crucial in today's rapidly evolving tech landscape.
