# What I find Interesting:
One interesting thing I find from the article is the mention of "low code development" as a trend. 
Low code development tools enable software creation without the need for much coding expertise, enhancing accessibility 
and cost-efficiency. On the other hand, the article underscores the continued significance of software engineering experts 
in supervising and ensuring the effectiveness of low-code solutions. This underscores the enduring value of software 
engineers in directing and enhancing software development procedures, even in the prevailing age of automation.
